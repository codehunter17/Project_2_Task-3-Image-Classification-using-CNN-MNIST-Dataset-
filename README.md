# 📸 Image Classification using CNN (MNIST Dataset) – Internship Task 3

## 📌 Task Objective:

For Task 3 of my internship, I built an **Image Classification Model** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in **TensorFlow (Keras)**.

The goal was to classify handwritten digit images from the **MNIST dataset**.

## 📂 Project Description:

✅ Loaded the **MNIST dataset** (handwritten digits 0–9)  
✅ Normalized the pixel values to improve model performance  
✅ Designed and built a **CNN architecture** with multiple **Conv2D**, **MaxPooling**, and **Dense layers**  
✅ Trained the CNN model on training data  
✅ Evaluated model performance on the test set  
✅ Plotted **accuracy and loss graphs** to analyze learning trends
